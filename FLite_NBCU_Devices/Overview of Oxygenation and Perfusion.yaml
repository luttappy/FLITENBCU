     answers:
        - It has two atrial and two ventricular chambers.
        - It pumps oxygenated blood to all parts of the body.

     answer: Pulmonary vein
Match the layers of cardiac muscles with their positions within the heart.:
     type: DRAG
     answers:
        Myocardium : Middle layer of muscle tissue in the heart.
        Epicardium : Outermost layer of heart muscle tissue.
        Endocardium : Innermost layer of heart muscle tissue. 
Venous blood returning from the body enters which heart chamber?:
     type: SINGLE
     answer: Right atrium
Which of these organs are parts of the upper respiratory tract?:
     type: MULTIPLE
     answers:
        - Nose, nasal cavity
        - Sinuses, pharynx
Through which parts of the respiratory tract does air pass after moving through the trachea?:
     type: MULTIPLE
     answers:
        - Bronchioles
        - Alveoli
"The process of oxygen diffusing across alveolar walls into pulmonary capillaries is called:":
     type: SINGLE
     answer: External respiration
"The process of exhalation involves:":
     type: SINGLE
     answer: Intraalveolar pressure rising above atmospheric pressure.
A nursing student is preparing to teach a patient how blood flows through the heart. In what order would the student place these steps to describe the process?:
     type: REORDER
     answers:
        1 : Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium via the superior and inferior vena cava.
        2 : Blood passes through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle.
        3 : Blood enters the lungs via the pulmonary artery and gas exchange occurs through the pulmonary capillary system.
        4 : Blood flows through pulmonary vein to the left atrium.
        5 : Blood moves through the mitral valve to the left ventricle.
        6 : Blood moves through the aortic valve into the aorta.
A patient with weak right ventricular systole asks what is wrong with his heart. What should the nurse say?:
     type: SINGLE
     answer: The right side of your heart is not pumping with enough force to propel an adequate amount of blood to the lungs.
Following damage to the epicardium, the nurse would expect which changes to occur in the heart wall?:
     type: MULTIPLE
     answers: 
        - Impaired secretion of serous fluid
        - Increased friction during heart contractions
"A patient with a chronic respiratory disease is to receive teaching about the breathing process. Information to include is that ventilation starts with inspiration and is triggered by:":
     type: SINGLE
     answer: Impulses in the respiratory center of the brain
"During the inspiratory phase of respiration, the phrenic nerve:":
     type: SINGLE
     answer: Stimulates the diaphragm to move downward
A nursing student is preparing to teach a patient the process of inspiration and expiration. In what order would the student place these steps to describe the process?:
     type: REORDER
     answers:
        1 : The respiratory center in the brain releases an impulse to nerves.
        2 : The phrenic nerve stimulates the diaphragm to move downward and the intercostal nerve causes the intercostal muscles to contract.
        3 : The chest cavity expands, causing decreased intraalveolar pressure.
        4 : Atmospheric pressure exceeds intraalveolar pressure, causing air to move into the respiratory tract and the lungs fill with air.
        5 : The diaphragm relaxes and intraalveolar pressure increases.
        6 : Air is forced out from the lungs.
